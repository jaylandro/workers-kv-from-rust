# Use Cloudflare Workers Key Value store directly from Rust

A template for kick starting a Cloudflare worker project using [`workers-rs`](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-rs).

https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/tutorials/workers-kv-from-rust

## Usage 

With `wrangler`, you can build, test, and deploy your Worker with the following commands: 

```bash
# compiles your project to WebAssembly and will warn of any issues
wrangler build 

# run your Worker in an ideal development workflow (with a local server, file watcher & more)
wrangler dev

# deploy your Worker globally to the Cloudflare network (update your wrangler.toml file for configuration)
wrangler publish
```

Read the latest `worker` crate documentation here: https://docs.rs/worker

## WebAssembly

`workers-rs` (the Rust SDK for Cloudflare Workers used in this template) is meant to be executed as 
compiled WebAssembly, and as such so **must** all the code you write and depend upon. All crates and
modules used in Rust-based Workers projects have to compile to the `wasm32-unknown-unknown` triple.
